# ThreatRaptor

Given a natural language description of an attack behavior, the ThreatRaptor system automatically searches for the matched system audit log records.

Specifically, the system (1) extracts attack behaviors from the description using NLP; (2) synthesizes a threat hunting query (a TBQL query) from the extracted behaviors; (3) executes the synthesized query over the database of system audit logs for threat hunting.

## How to install

### 1. Install st2g

Install from [here](https://github.com/security-kg/st2g)

### 2. Build ANTLR 4 parser files

Tested using Antlr 4.7.1 for MacOS

#### ANTLR 4 configuration notes

`antlr` script in `/usr/local/bin/`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
java -cp "/usr/local/lib/antlr4-4.7.1-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH" org.antlr.v4.Tool $*
```

`grun` script in `/usr/local/bin/`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
java -cp "/usr/local/lib/antlr4-4.7.1-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH" org.antlr.v4.runtime.misc.TestRig $*
```

#### ANTLR 4 running notes

Generate java files:

```bash
cd scripts/grammar
./build_tbql.sh # use antlr 4.7.1 to generate parser files
```

### 3. Optional: Build UI

Build JS files

```bash
# Under the /frontent directory
npm install
npm run build
```

### 4. Optional: Prepare the database

The TBQL query needs to run on a database of system audit logging records.

To generate a log file using Sysdig and parse the log file into a database, refer to the [provenance-parser](https://github.com/seclab-vt/provenance-parser) repo.

## How to run

* Create database for system audit logging data (can try example database `input/example/logsanalyzer_2019_10_06.sql`)

* Configure `cfg/database/*.properties`

### Run the TBQL query component only

* Run `Main.java -> runBQL()` (executes the query `input\example\tbql_sql.tbql`)

`input\example` gives several other example TBQL queries that ThreatRaptor supports. For queries with the variable length path syntax, the Neo4j database needs to be set up.

Depending on the type of event pattern/event path, the query system will automatically generate a SQL or Cypher query for retrieving intermediate results.

### Run the end-to-end pipeline

* Run `Main.java -> runPipeline()`

The system will take in a natural language attack behavior description as an input (e.g., `input/example/attack_description.txt`), construct an attack behavior graph in DOT format, synthesize a TBQL query from the graph, and execute the query to find the matched system audit logs records.

### Run the UI

* Run `Main.java -> runWeb()`
* UI is at `localhost:8080`

## A demo case

Natural language description of attak behavior (`input/example/attack_description.txt`):

```txt
First, /usr/bin/wget will be started by /bin/bash . It downloads some data from 162.125.6.6, then writes the data to sysrep_exp_data.txt.
```

Attack behavior graph in DOT format:

```txt
digraph {
 0 [label="/usr/bin/wget" xlabel=LinuxFilepath]
 1 [label="/bin/bash" xlabel=LinuxFilepath]
 2 [label="162.125.6.6" xlabel=IP]
 3 [label="sysrep_exp_data.txt" xlabel=Filename]
 1 -> 0 [label=start xlabel="[0]"]
 0 -> 2 [label=download xlabel="[1]"]
 0 -> 3 [label=write xlabel="[2]"]
}
```

Synthesized TBQL query (can configure `SecurityOperationGraph.java` for different options)

```txt
proc p1['%/bin/bash%'] start proc p2['%/usr/bin/wget%'] as evt1
proc p2['%/usr/bin/wget%'] read ip i1['162.125.6.6'] as evt2
proc p2['%/usr/bin/wget%'] write file f1['%sysrep_exp_data.txt%'] as evt3
with evt1 before evt2, evt2 before evt3
return distinct p1, p2, i1, f1
```

Retrieved system audit logs records from database:

```txt
/bin/bash, /usr/bin/wget, 162.125.6.6, /home/pxf109/Reptracker/sysrep_case_scripts/complex_case/complex_case/sysrep_exp_data.txt?dl=0
[p1.exename, p2.exename, i1.dstip, f1.name]

```
